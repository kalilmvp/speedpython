# speedpython

Python routine used to verify with the speedtest-client what is the down/up speed hired by the user and to monitor according to his will.
In case the speed is low or does not attend the minimum requirements, a tweet is sent for the specific company that supports the Internet 
service.

On the example, it is used one of the biggest operators on Brazil, Claro, the supplier of the best 4G signal coverage, as it says.


I guess not!
